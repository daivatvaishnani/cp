Reasons why I find Pseudocode 1 better:
1.	It has more flexibility
	For e.g. I have two methods 'getCurrentShows' and 'findSlots' which any team member can use to implement many other functionalities. It might not be the case with second version.


2.	The methods are more Generalized/Atomic 
	The case for 'createShowSchedule' methods, the method in the first pseudocode is more generalized it works for a slot and we can easily play around with any slot. Whereas the second versions requires a array of slots for each day and it will do the work.
